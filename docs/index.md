# Professional Self-Assessment

Welcome! This ePortfolio showcases enhancements to **batchRename**, a Python-based multi-tool I use as a paralegal to streamline file operations for discovery responses.

This front page is my **Professional Self-Assessment**, followed by links to the code review and the enhancement narratives.

## Who I Am & What This Portfolio Demonstrates
- Full-time paralegal transitioning into software development; focused on pragmatic automation and usable tooling.
- This portfolio evidences:
  - **Collaboration & communication:** structured code review, clear UI/UX, documented configs.
  - **Data structures & algorithms:** collision-safe renaming, batch undo, recursive scans with de-duplication.
  - **Software engineering & databases:** modular architecture, config management, SQLite schema & ingestion.
  - **Security mindset:** input/path validation, parameterized SQL, cautious file operations.

## How Coursework + Capstone Shaped My Readiness
- Planning with **pseudocode/UML** before coding; writing testable units; refactoring for clarity.
- Database comfort via **SQLite** for durable, queryable records that match real legal workflows.
- UX details (toasts, defaults, safe paths) to serve non-technical users.
