# Professional Self-Assessment

Welcome to my CS 499 ePortfolio. This site presents the final artifact enhancements and supporting narratives for my capstone project, based on the program I developed and use professionally: **batchRename**, now titled **Barron Pagel File Utilities**.

## A. Program Reflection and Skills Gained

Throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU, I’ve gained a practical foundation in building tools that solve real-world problems. Developing this portfolio helped me consolidate that experience and reflect on the skills I now bring to the table.

During the program, I became more confident in planning out logic before writing code—especially through structured pseudocode, flowcharts, and UML diagrams. For example, I’ve learned to define workflows using command patterns and to model modular systems that scale. Outside the classroom, I used these skills in my work as a paralegal by building a Python utility to automate file renaming for discovery responses—a tool that has since expanded into a broader multi-tool suite.

My coursework helped me grow in the following areas:

- **Collaboration in team environments:** I participated in peer discussions, reviewed code, and documented my own work clearly for maintainability and transferability. My capstone code review video simulates a team-facing walkthrough, emphasizing decisions and trade-offs rather than implementation alone.
  
- **Communicating with stakeholders:** The interface design in this project, along with persistent settings and user-facing messaging, was informed by daily experience communicating with non-technical coworkers. I’ve also improved in writing professional documentation (as seen in the updated README and narrative submissions).

- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** I’ve implemented efficient, scalable logic using dictionaries for collision detection, stacks for undo functionality, and recursive directory scanning to locate and evaluate files by structured patterns.

- **Software Engineering and Databases:** I refactored monolithic code into modular components, applied design patterns like Command and MVC, and integrated a relational SQLite backend for persistent state tracking.

- **Security Mindset:** Input validation and parameterized SQL statements are now standard in my approach. I’ve adopted a cautious stance toward file handling and data persistence, storing sensitive data in user-controlled locations and avoiding unnecessary exposure.

Together, these experiences have shaped me into a pragmatic, solution-oriented developer—someone who builds tools that matter in day-to-day workflows. Whether I pursue roles in legal tech, internal tools, or standalone desktop applications, I now feel equipped with the skills and professional awareness to take that next step.

## B. Artifact Overview and Integration

The three enhancements shown here are all built around a single evolving application: **Barron Pagel File Utilities**. This reflects a real-world trajectory of iterative software development—rather than building isolated demo projects, I chose to improve and scale a tool that I already depend on professionally.

Each enhancement aligns with a core domain in computer science:

- **Software Engineering:** Refactoring into a modular, multi-tool GUI with a persistent configuration layer and improved UI consistency.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures:** Introducing undo functionality, optimized file parsing logic, and safe rename operations using structured data flows.
- **Databases:** Implementing a relational SQLite system with client management, duplicate prevention, and integrated statement tracking.

These enhancements are interdependent—improving structure allowed for easier implementation of algorithms, which in turn made it practical to track metadata persistently. This ePortfolio not only demonstrates technical competency across the three targeted areas but also illustrates how those competencies converge in a maintainable, user-focused product.
