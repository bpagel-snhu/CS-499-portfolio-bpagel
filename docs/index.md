# Professional Self-Assessment

I built this portfolio to present the work I’m most proud of from the Computer Science program and to show how I now approach problems as a developer. It’s meant to read like a hiring manager’s shortcut: how I think, how I communicate, and how I turn ambiguous real-world needs into reliable software. The code review, narratives, and tagged “original vs. final” releases provide traceable evidence for the claims I make here.

## A. How the program and ePortfolio shaped my strengths, goals, and readiness

**What changed.** Across the program—and especially while assembling this ePortfolio—I shifted from “just make it work” to designing for testability, rollback, portability, and user trust. I’m targeting roles where pragmatic automation and usable tooling matter (internal tools, legal tech, or small engineering teams that value ownership). The ePortfolio process forced me to distill technical decisions for a mixed audience and to present verifiable improvements, which mirrors real stakeholder communication.

**Examples (beyond this artifact).**
- **Coursework:** Data structures/algorithms reinforced writing to invariants and preconditions; testing courses pushed isolating side effects; reverse/software engineering strengthened reading unfamiliar code and reasoning about design trade-offs.
- **Professional context:** In family law, I translate domain rules into unambiguous logic and UIs non-technical people can actually use. Real users, real data, real deadlines sharpened my bias for simplicity and failure-tolerant design.

**Overall skills snapshot (not an artifact discussion):**
- **Collaborating in a team environment:** I plan/code-review with structure, leave contextual in-code comments, and document decisions so others can follow the logic quickly. That’s the same discipline I use to support stakeholder decisions outside engineering.
- **Communicating with stakeholders:** I package changes in concise READMEs, UI copy, and short demos. I tailor explanations—business impact for legal staff; design trade-offs and risk notes for technical reviewers.
- **Data structures and algorithms:** I design pipelines that separate “plan” from “apply,” use sets/maps for O(1) duplicate detection, and rely on stack-based undo for transactional safety. I write pseudocode first when it clarifies trade-offs.
- **Software engineering and databases:** I prefer modular boundaries, config-driven behavior, and cross-platform paths; for persistence I use SQLite with a normalized schema and parameterized queries. I document defaults and fail-safes so behavior is predictable.
- **Security mindset:** I validate inputs at boundaries, avoid executing untrusted data, and minimize stored PII. I think about error states and reversibility early; preventing data loss is cheaper than recovery.

## B. How the artifacts fit together

This portfolio is intentionally cohesive: one real-world application enhanced along three dimensions—**software engineering/design**, **algorithms & data structures**, and **databases**—introduced here and detailed on the Enhancements page. The **code review** establishes the baseline; the **narratives** explain design decisions and trade-offs; and the **release tags** make the “before vs. after” verifiable. Together, they present how I design, reason, and communicate—so a reviewer sees both breadth and depth before reading any source file.
